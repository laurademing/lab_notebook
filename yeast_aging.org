first issue
- get large numbers of old mother cells
- single cell analysis
- evolve long-lived mothers screen design?
- genetic screens for lifespan in overexpression / mutant strains

- healthy cell metrics
  - makes the same density of ATP as a normal cell
  - eats the same total amount of energy per second as a normal cell
  - turns over protein at the same rate as a normal cell
    - are there any cells that don't do this but are still healthy?
    - random q: what % of the cell is dedicated to turning over / producing protein?


- damage types
  - probably an issue
    - % of proteins that are functional
    - # of proteins that are functional
    - decreased mitochondrial membrane potential
      - how bad is this, is the mitochondria still able to function in older age
    - mitochondrial fragmentation
      - is this correlated to decreased mitochondrial efficiency?
      - is this bad?
    - metabolism changes
      - decreased glycolysis
	- by how much, could be bad
    - increased ROS
      - by how much
      - what other bad things increase?
      - do you see corresponding increase in damaged molecules?
    - more protein aggregation
      - HSP104 used as an example for carbonyl-damage associated protein aggregates
      - does the toal amount of protein aggregation in the cell change over time?
      - does it obviously get in the way of anything?

- not sure if an issue or helping
    - some genes change in expression / less histones
      - which genes change the most?
      - do all genes increase in expression?
      - if you artificially increase the expression of all genes, would you expect this to be bad?
      - does this just happen from less histones?
      
  - not clear if an issue
    - cell size increases
      - does it always increase?
      - would be an issue if didn't have a corresponding increase in energy flow through the cell
      - is there an optimal yeast size? or are yeast fine at multiple size?
      - what % of genes in the genome control yeast size?
    - decreased resistance to stress
      - mutagen
      - other stress
      - increased resistance to UV - what does thi smean?
    - vacuolar pH increases
    - oxidative protein damage
    - increased glucose storage
      - does anything change other than gluconeogenesis?
	- does glucose flux in stay the same but glycolysis changes?
    - ERCs
      - What do these hurt?
      - How much energy do these take up?
      - How much space do these take up?
      - Does having a lot of these change anthing about ribosome assembly or dynamics in a bad way?
    - Bud scars
    - Big nucleolus
      - Is this bad? Does this mean more protein is made?
      - Does this still happen if the cell does not get bigger? 
      - Does the % of nucleolus to cell increase?
    - more mtDNA
      - does this mean mitochondria?
      - does this still happen if fix membrane potential?
    

- might tell you how healthy a cell is
  - they get less good at sporulating
  - random budding pattern with age
  - mating frequency decreases
  - daughters live less long
  - decreased pheromone responsex

- stuff that happens early
  - mitochondrial dysfunction

- stuff right before death
  - size dramatically increases in last ~3 divisions
  - daughter cells of old mother sometimes larger than mother
  - vacuole doesn't re-form after fragmenting
  - something bursts / stop seeing fluorescent protein expression
  - stop seeing complete division / see ellpisoid daughters
    - do you ever see ellipsoid daughters even when this hasn't happened?



Questions
- What organelles increase with age? Which decrease?
- Do we care if they increase or decrease?
  - Do larger and smaller yeast mutants with similar lifespan exist?
- What is mitochondrial redox potential?
- Why is ROS characterized as bad, and what other things have that property?
