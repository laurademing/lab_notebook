Technical problems wrt making an immortal yeast:

EVOLVE

Set up a system where long-lived yeast are selected for over multiple generations. 

Unknowns: 
Experiment design (MM had idea for selecting chronologically, then weeding out slow-growing daughters every cycle)
Are there other good ways to do this?
If the experiment design involves microfluidics, cost and difficulty to set up
Potential fast and cheap device to set up to get a feel for the system - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468501119300069
How many cycles of directed evolution would we guess this would require, and how long would that take?
Yeast genome is ~12M bp, mutation rate is (10^-10), ~10^9 yeast per 1 ml of culture
Cost for whole-genome sequencing given # of cycles

BIOLOGY

Try to use sporulation biology to regenerate yeast

Unknowns: 
Best next step for this experiment - expressing Ndt80 at different levels and time periods?

ENGINEER

(prob not worth doing in tandem)
Try to specifically reverse the accumulation of different types of damage in yeast

Unknowns:
What damage, by how much to reverse

EVALUATE

Define success criteria for the experiment

Unknowns:
How should this be defined?
